  \brief Receive data from the network

  Concrete implementation of the Receiver trait
  Handle as quickly as possible.
  Make a copy of the received data, and set a notification flag, then return.
  Clients can poll the flag to know when new data is available for processing.
  If another thread holds the buffer mutex, return 0 immediately.

  \param self - the receiver
  \param data - the data to receive
  \param length - the length of data that is available
  \return the number of bytes received
